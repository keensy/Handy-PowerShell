.SYNOPSIS
This script sets the system time zone based on the Australian state entered by the user.

.DESCRIPTION
This script prompts the user to enter an Australian state abbreviation (e.g., NSW, QLD, VIC, etc.).
It checks if the entered state is valid and sets the corresponding time zone for the system.
If an unrecognized state is entered, the script notifies the user to enter a valid state.
